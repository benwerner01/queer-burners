          Queer Burners and/or our affiliates may at times contact you at your

          Burners-related opportunities. Should you not wish to receive such
          communications, you may opt out by following the instructions in the
          communication. If Queer Burners is acquired or transferred, or changes
          entity status, the personal information maintained on our systems will
          be among the transferred assets but will remain subject to the Queer
          Burners privacy policy in existence at the time of the acquisition or
          transfer.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can contact us at the address provided below to request access to
          the personal information on our Site. You can edit personal
          information on any camps that you have submitted to the directory by
          logging in and manually editing those camps. You can also delete your
          camp, either directly within the camp listing or by sending us an
          email that specifies the account or other data that you would like
          deleted. For technical reasons, the information that you have
          voluntarily shared in public submissions to our Site may remain
          visible to users of our Site even after the deletion of the associated
          account.
        </p>
        <h3>CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</h3>
        <p>
          The only people who have access to personal information collected on
          our Site have a need to know this information and are bound by
          nondisclosure agreements and this privacy policy. We have physical,
          electronic, and procedural safeguards in place to protect the personal
          information that we collect and store.
        </p>
        <p>
          You understand, however, that whenever you submit a camp listing, your
          submission will be made public on the Site. We are not responsible for
          the use of any personal information that you or others choose to post
          publicly. You may be identified as the author of any posted expressive
          content unless you instruct us otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will identify your public submissions to our Site by the contact
          information you include in the camp listing, and will not disseminate
          any other registration information without your authorization. If you
          contact other users of our Site by email, your personal information
          may be included in the header, as with any email.

        <p>
          Please note that our Site may contain links to third-party websites.
          These third-party websites may send their own cookies to collect data
          and solicit personal information. Therefore, we cannot guarantee your
